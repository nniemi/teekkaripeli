## Teekkarigame

**This school project was done with a pair, the other contributor is @Real-bay**

This program is a version of the traditional game of hangman, made with
a healthy dose of teekkarihumor. The program contains 18 different
words, which can then be guessed by the user. Guessed letters show up at the
bottom half of the GUI in alphabetical order. If the user has a total of nine
wrong guesses, the user loses the game.

Everytime the user guesses a letter correctly, it will be shown in a label at
the correct position corresponding to the randomized word. The program saves
data from recent games and tracks wins and losses. The data will be shown at
the bottom of the GUI.

The user can guess letters using a virtual keyboard. When a correct letter is
guessed, that key becomes locked on the keyboard. When the user wins/loses the
whole keyboard becomes locked. A new game can be started by pressing the
reset-button. The whole program can be shut down by pressing the quit-button.

Below the guessed letters label there is a counter to indicate how many guesses
the user still has before they lose the game.

*A simple example of the game, shows the result when winning and losing*



The GUI is in finnish since it is easier to operate, english version is pretty easy to implement although. This project scored 200/200 on our Introduction to programming -course during our first-year of studies.
